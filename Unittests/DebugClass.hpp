	\brief A class that is made to test containers.

	\details
	This class counts how many instances of it were constructed and how many were destructed
	(stored in a counter, that can be retrieved via getCounter()). For every construction the
	counter is incremented by one, for every destruction it is decremented by one. As long as 
	all constructed instances were also destructed, this counter should always be 0 after a
	container was in use.

	It also can store an integer value. May be used to compare instances of this class (the
	overloaded compare operators will simply compare that value) and it can also be used to 
	check weather an instance that, e.g. was popped from a container is the correct one by 
	checking the value.
